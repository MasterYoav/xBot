 * of tools somebody else maintains, and the Bots a deployment has are whatever was made here. It is
 * also the question a person asks while looking at a Bot, not while looking at a vendor.
 *
 * DIRECTIONAL, and said so on the screen, because the pair is the one thing about this that is easy
 * to get backwards: this is who this Bot may ask, not who may ask it.
 *
 * One Item per candidate, with a Switch: the grant is one boolean that takes effect when switched,
 * which is exactly the row kind a Switch means everywhere else in this app.
